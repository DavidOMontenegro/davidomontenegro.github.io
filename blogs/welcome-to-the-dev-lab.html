        <h1>Welcome to the Dev Lab</h1>
        <p>
            After years of building projects, experimenting with new technologies, and constantly jumping between languages, frameworks, and ideas, I finally sat down and built something I’ve needed for a long time: a personal space on the internet that’s fully mine. No templates. No social-media algorithms. No clutter. Just a clean, evolving home for my work, my thoughts, and a few fun extras I’ve wanted to share with the world.
        </p>
        <br>

        <p>
            This blog post marks the official launch of the site, even if some parts are still works in progress. My goal here is to give you a clear idea of what this site is, why I created it, and what you can expect going forward. There are three main pillars to the site: the blog, the project pages, and the browser-playable games.
        </p>
        <br>

        <h2>Why I Built This Site</h2>
        <p>
            Whenever I make a videogame, create a tool, or start tinkering with a new technology, I usually end up with one of two outcomes: either the project lives forever in a GitHub repo without context, or it sits hidden away, unfinished, because I didn’t have a place or reason to share it. Over time, I realized how much knowledge, experimentation, and trial-and-error was just sitting there, quietly gathering dust.
        </p>
        <br>

        <p>
            This site is my answer to that.
        </p>
        <br>

        <p>
            I wanted a space where I could document my technical journey. The polished end results, but also the thoughts, ideas, challenges, and lessons behind them. A space where I could write freely about what I’m learning and producing. A place where people like you can browse my projects and understand why I built each one instead of just what it does (and maybe even hire me to build something for <em>you</em> &#128521;). And, of course, because I’ve always loved working on small creative projects, I wanted to sprinkle in some interactive stuff, such as these simple static games that you can play directly in your browser.
        </p>
        <br>

        <p>
            In short, I built this site because I wanted a more complete way to share who I am as a developer. Not just code. Not just posts. But a living collection of the things I build, think about, and enjoy.
        </p>
        <br>

        <h2>The Blogs</h2>
        <p>
            This blog will be the most fluid and evolving part of the site. I’ll use it to share a wide range of content, including:
        </p>
        <br>

        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Deep dives into backend development</strong>: architecture choices, patterns, mistakes I’ve made, and things I’ve learned through trial and error.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Post-mortems of projects</strong>: what went right, what went wrong, and what I’d do differently next time.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Explorations of languages and tools</strong>: from Java and Go to Python, Node.js, TypeScript, and beyond.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Progress updates</strong>: what I’m currently working on, new features being added to the site, or long-term goals I’m pursuing.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Occasional personal reflections</strong>: not diary entries, but thoughts on career growth, learning strategies, and navigating the tech world as a continuous student.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <br>

        <p>
            My goal is for the blog to become a long-term logbook. Not every post will be ultra-technical or deeply polished. Some will be quick thoughts, some will be guides, and some might be long discussions on decisions I’m making behind the scenes. If you’re here because you’re a fellow developer, I hope the posts give you something useful. If you’re here to follow my work, I hope the posts give you insight into how my projects come to life.
        </p>
        <br>

        <h2>The Projects</h2>
        <p>
            This section is one of the main reasons I created the site. I’ve built (and am still building) a growing list of backend systems, APIs, tools, and experiments across different languages and frameworks. I want each project to have its own dedicated page where I break down:
        </p>
        <br>

        <ul>
            <li>What the project does</li>
            <li>Why I built it</li>
            <li>The technologies I chose, and why I chose them</li>
            <li>The architecture and design decisions</li>
            <li>Challenges I ran into and how I solved them</li>
            <li>What I learned</li>
            <li>What I’d like to improve or extend in the future</li>
        </ul>
        <br>

        <p>
            Essentially: the kinds of details that wouldn't fit into a README, but make all the difference when someone is trying to understand your thinking as a developer.
        </p>
        <br>

        <div class="annotation">
            <strong>Important note:</strong>
            <p>
                None of the project descriptions are finished yet. The pages exist, but they’re placeholders for now.
            </p>
        </div>
        <br>

        <p>
            I didn’t want to delay launching the site just because I’m still writing the descriptions. But you can expect the first full project breakdowns to start appearing soon. I’ll likely publish them gradually, focusing first on my most relevant recent projects and then expanding from there. Once they begin rolling out, I’ll also write blog posts announcing each new project write-up.
        </p>
        <br>

        <h2>The Games</h2>
        <p>
            The third part of this site is much less serious, but just as intentional: a collection of small, lightweight games that run right in your browser. These aren’t meant to be complex masterpieces. They’re simple, fun, and usually created as experiments. Just ways for me to practice frontend logic, animation, or even just to take a break from backend-heavy work.
        </p>
        <br>

        <p>
            I think most developers my age initially fell in love with the craft out of a dream to create their own videogames. As a backend developer, I'm not particularly fond of programming for the browser like this, but I thought it would make a nice addition to the site. This is basically the easiest way I could get simple game projects up and running. And if you end up wasting a few pleasant minutes on them, all the better.
        </p>
        <br>
        
        <h2>What to Expect Going Forward</h2>
        <p>
            Now that the site is live, here’s what you can look forward to:
        </p>
        <br>

        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Semi-regular blog posts</strong>: starting with devlogs, project thoughts, and broader reflections.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Project descriptions rolling out one by one</strong>: each with detailed insights and explanations.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Small browser games</strong>: added whenever inspiration strikes.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Continuous improvement</strong>: better styling, better performance, more interactivity, and new features as I experiment.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <br>

        <p>
            This site isn’t meant to be static. It’s meant to grow with me as I learn, build, make mistakes, and try new things.
        </p>
        <br>

        <h2>Thank You for Being Here</h2>
        <p>
            Whether you’re a developer, a friend, a potential employer, or someone who just stumbled onto the site by accident, thank you for checking it out. Launching something personal is always a bit intimidating, it feels like putting a piece of yourself out there. But it’s also exciting, and I’m looking forward to seeing where this goes.
        </p>
        <br>

        <p>
            If you want to follow along, explore the blog, check out the games, or come back soon for the first batch of project descriptions. There’s a lot more coming! This is just the starting point.
