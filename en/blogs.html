        <h1>Blogs</h1>
        <p>
            These are my blogs. Here, you'll find information on my personal projects and my overall experience with software development. I'll also try to share my thoughts and opinions about various topics related to the tech industry. I hope you can derive something of value from my writings - whether it be a solution to a problem I've alredy faced or a new insight on the industry as a whole. These are all written without the assistance of AI (I am trying to include dashes in my writing, but I swear it's just me).
