        <h1>Welcome to the Dev Lab</h1>
        <p>
            As a software engineer, everyone's always been telling me I needed a portfolio to demonstrate my skills (LinkedIn's Projects section won't suffice). And as a developer advocate, everyone's always been telling me that I needed to increase my visibility and get my voice out there. So, I finally decided to create a site of my own where I can do both of these things. Although I'd love to go viral, I decided to make this space more personal by doing everything myself. I won't be following "proven templates" or exploiting social media algorithms. I won't bombard anyone with loads and loads of AI-generated content. This is a place where I can document the projects I build from scratch using only my mind and where I can write what I think about it all.
        </p>
        <br>

        <p>
            This blog post marks the official launch of the site, even if some parts are still works in progress (including the name). My goal here is to give you a clear idea of what this site is, why I created it, and what you can expect going forward. There are three main pillars to the site: the blog, the project pages, and the browser-playable games.
        </p>
        <br>

        <h2>Why I Built This Site</h2>
        <p>
            Like everyone else, whenever I start a new project that I'm very excited about, it usually ends up unfinished, sitting in a hard-to-find GitHub repository. Sometimes, life gets in the way and I no longer have time to work on it, sometimes I just slowly fall out of love with the project as the architecture and design phase become monotonous maintenance. Over time, I realized how much knowledge, experimentation, and trial-and-error was just sitting there, quietly gathering dust because I had no reason to finish it or share it.
        </p>
        <br>

        <p>
            This site gives me a reason to complete these tasks. I get to share the polished end results, but also the thoughts, ideas, challenges, and lessons behind them. Here, people like you can browse my projects and understand why I built each one instead of just what it does (and maybe even hire me to build something for <em>you</em> &#128521;). And, of course, because I’ve always loved working on small creative projects, I wanted to make this site interactive, hence the simple static games you can play directly in your browser.
        </p>
        <br>

        <p>
            In short, I built this site because I wanted a more complete way to share who I am as a developer. Not just code. Not just noise. But a living collection of the things I build, think about, and enjoy.
        </p>
        <br>

        <h2>The Blogs</h2>
        <p>
            To be honest, I'm still thinking about what I'll write. I plan on sharing a wide range of content, including:
        </p>
        <br>

        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Deep dives into backend development</strong>: architecture choices, patterns, mistakes I’ve made, and things I’ve learned through trial and error.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Explorations of languages and tools</strong>: from Java and Go to Python, Node.js, TypeScript, and beyond.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Progress updates</strong>: what I’m currently working on, new features being added to the site, or long-term goals I’m pursuing.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Personal reflections</strong>: not diary entries, but thoughts on career growth, learning strategies, and navigating the tech world as a continuous student. I might get a little political, but I can assure you I am not tribalistic or partisan.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <br>

        <p>
            My goal is for the blog to connect with people and reveal more about how I think. Not every post will be ultra-technical or deeply polished. Some will be quick thoughts, some will be guides, and some might be long educated rants about the state of the world.
        </p>
        <br>

        <h2>The Projects</h2>
        <p>
            This section is one of the main reasons I created the site. I’ve built (and am still building) a growing list of backend systems, APIs, tools, and experiments across different languages and frameworks. I want each project to have its own dedicated page where I break down:
        </p>
        <br>

        <ul>
            <li>What the project does</li>
            <li>Why I built it</li>
            <li>The technologies I chose, and why I chose them</li>
            <li>The architecture and design decisions</li>
            <li>Challenges I ran into and how I solved them</li>
            <li>What I learned</li>
            <li>What I’d like to improve or extend in the future</li>
        </ul>
        <br>

        <p>
            Essentially: the kinds of details that wouldn't fit into a README, but make all the difference when someone is trying to understand your thinking as a developer.
        </p>
        <br>

        <div class="admonition">
            <strong>Important note:</strong>
            <p>
                None of the project descriptions are finished yet. The pages exist, but they’re placeholders for now.
            </p>
        </div>
        <br>

        <p>
            I didn’t want to delay launching the site just because I’m still writing the descriptions. But you can expect the first full project breakdowns to start appearing soon™. I’ll likely publish them gradually, focusing first on my most relevant recent projects and then expanding from there. Once they begin rolling out, I’ll also write blog posts announcing each new project write-up.
        </p>
        <br>

        <h2>The Games</h2>
        <p>
            The third part of this site is much less serious, but just as intentional: a collection of small, lightweight games that run right in your browser. These aren’t meant to be complex masterpieces. They’re simple, fun, and usually created as experiments. Just ways for me to practice frontend logic, animation, or even just to take a break from backend-heavy work. I hope I have time to actually get around to these.
        </p>
        <br>

        <p>
            I think most developers my age initially fell in love with the craft out of a dream to create their own videogames. As a backend developer, I'm not particularly fond of programming for the browser like this, but I thought it would make a nice addition to the site. This is basically the easiest way I could get simple game projects up and running. And if you end up wasting a few pleasant minutes on them, all the better.
        </p>
        <br>
        
        <h2>What to Expect Going Forward</h2>
        <p>
            Now that the site is live, here’s what you can look forward to:
        </p>
        <br>

        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Semi-regular blog posts</strong>: I'll make an effort to write whenever possible (once a week?).
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Project descriptions</strong>: I'm still working on a template for them. But once I have that, they'll start rolling out one by one.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Small browser games</strong>: I'll add them whenever inspiration strikes.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Continuous improvement</strong>: better styling, better performance, more interactivity, and new features as I experiment.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <br>

        <p>
            This site isn’t meant to be static. It’s meant to grow with me as I learn, build, make mistakes, and try new things.
        </p>
        <br>

        <h2>Thank You for Being Here</h2>
        <p>
            Whether you’re a developer, a friend, a potential employer, or someone who just stumbled onto the site by accident, thank you for checking it out. Launching something personal is always a bit intimidating and, unless I commit, it'll also end up a bit embarassing. But it’s also exciting, and I’m looking forward to seeing where this goes.
        </p>
        <br>

        <p>
            If you want to follow along, explore the blog, check out the games, or come back soon for the first batch of project descriptions. There’s a lot more coming! This is just the starting point.
