            Hello, world! I'm David Montenegro, a sort of T-shaped developer advocate with a passion for the craft of software development. I started programming when I was 15, using Google Grasshopper to learn JavaScript. Over the years, in my quest to become a software engineer, I've worked in just about every job you can think of in tech: manual and automated QA tester, technical writer, systems developer, operations analyst... But I've never outgrown that initial love of writing code that made me want to enter the industry in the first place.

            I built this site because I wanted something more personal and intentional than my GitHub full of unfinished work. I wanted a place where I could organize my projects, document what I’m learning, and share a bit of my perspective on the world. If you’d like a deeper explanation of why this site exists and what I’m hoping to do with it, I wrote an extended introduction in my first blog post: <a href="/en/blogs/welcome-to-the-dev-lab.html">Welcome to The Dev Lab</a>.
