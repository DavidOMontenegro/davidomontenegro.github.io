        <h1>The Dev Lab</h1>
        <p>
            Hello, world! I'm David, a backend developer with a passion for building creative digital experiences. This site is my home on the web: a place where I share my projects, write about what I’m exploring, and occasionally release small games just for fun.
        </p>
        <br>

        <p>
            I built this site because I wanted something more personal and intentional than scattered GitHub repositories or half-finished notes. I wanted a place where I could organize my projects, document what I’m learning, and give meaningful context to the things I build. If you’d like a deeper explanation of why this site exists and what I’m hoping to do with it, I wrote an extended introduction in my first blog post: <a href="/blogs/welcome-to-the-dev-lab.html">Welcome to The Dev Lab</a>.
        </p>
